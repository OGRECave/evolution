# OGRE Evolution Proposals

This maintains proposals for changes and enhancements to OGRE.
For small things you can submit [bug reports or feature requests](https://github.com/OGRECave/ogre/issues).
For big things that take several man-weeks or even man-months to implement, issues are rather inappropriate.
Instead you should use this *OGRE Evolution Mechanism* which we shamelessly copy from [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Evolution-Proposals), which they improved from [Python PEPs](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/).

The proposals must follow the [common template](OEP-00-Template.md) and bring the ideas into spotlight for public discussion. To add your proposal simply create a pull-request against this repository. If the core team approves your idea, it will be merged into the repository.

The pool of proposals can then be used to plan GSoC projects, as the list of possible projects for volunteers who would like to contribute to OGRE etc.
